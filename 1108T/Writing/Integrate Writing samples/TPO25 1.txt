In the passage, there are three possible reasons that explain the fact that vessels found in Iraq might not be used as electric batteries in ancient times. However, this statement is not in agreement with the lecture which points out that those ideas are not convencing.

Firstly, the reading passage asserts that if the vessels were used as batterise, some conducters might be used to work with the vessels, but no such conductors were founded. Nevertheless, the professor, in contrast to the reading, insists that the people who found those vessels were some locals not the archaeologists. It is possible that some other materials may be neglected by the local residents such as the conductors.

Secondly, according to the reading, the copper cylinders founded in the jars just look like the ones discovered in Seleucia where the copper cylinders were used for holding scrolls. On the contrary, the professor disapproves of this viewpoint and proposes that copper cylinders which were made to hold the scrolls can not support the idea. Although the copper cylinders in the jars might have the function to hold the scrolls just like the ones founded in Seleucia, they could also founction as the batteries by working with some other materials.

Finally, the author in the reading passage addresses that at that time there was no devices for people to make ues of the electricity generated by the vessels, but the speakers is skeptical about this opinion. She maintains that there did exist some scenes that people can use the electricity. For example, the local people might use the electricity to shock people in order to demostrate their magic power or to heal the patients.
