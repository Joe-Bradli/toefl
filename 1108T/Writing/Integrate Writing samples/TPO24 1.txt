In the passage, there are three possible theories that explain that T.rex's fossils may reveal the existance of blood vessels, red blood cells, and collagen matrix. However, this statement is not in agreement with the lecture which point out that those hypotheses are skeptical.

Firstly, the reading passage asserts that T.rex's leg bone revealed some branching channels which might indicating the existence of the blood vessels. Nevertheless, the professor, in contrast to the reading, insists that the blood vessels were pobably formed by other organisms such as bacterias beacuse such organisms can colonize the turnnal and serveal remains of the colonization were indeed found in those fossils.

Secondly, according to the reading, there are numerous shperes founded in the inner bone of the fossils which might possibly suggest that red blood cells existed. On the contrary, the professor disapproves of this view point and proposes that the spheres could not be the evidence of the blood cells because those spheres were also found in the animals which didn't have any blood cells like primatives. The spheres might formed in other places.

Finally, the auhor in the reading passage addresses that the leg bone tested by scientists contained collagen, but the speaker is skeptical about this opinion. She miantains that the collagen cannot last longer than one hundred thousand years. If this collagen was really found in the leg bone, it would contradict with the current acknowledge. Furthermore, the collagen might come from other animals like human skins.
